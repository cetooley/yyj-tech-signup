## Creating a Page

To create a new page in Gatsby, this project has been set up to work from Markdown

Decide on the url, e.g. "community-resources"

1. Duplicate the `pages/example.js` page and rename the file to the url you have decided on (e.g. `community-resources.js`)
2. 
3. Replace the related content in this file
  * Replace the `const Example` on line 9 e.g. `const CommunityResources` a
  * Repalce the query on line 34 with your file name e.g. `quuery CommunityResourcesQuery`
  * Replace teh slug param on line 35 wit your slug e.g. ` eq: "/community-resources"`
  * Replace `export default Example` line at the end of the file with your url name e.g. `export default CommunityResources`
4. Duplicate the `contents/example.md` file
5. Rename the file to match your url e.g. `community-resources.md`
6. Replace the slug parameter with your desired url e.g. `slug: "/community-resources"` 
7. If you now use the `npm start` command, if you've done it right you will be able to see your new url in your browser
